name: Check wasm-bindgen changes

# Tests expand macro output. This changes a lot based on the version of wasm-bindgen that is installed
# This cron job is meant to create a PR whenever there are changes to the expanded macro output.
# Since all PRs that affect tsify's macro output should update their own tests, this should only detect
# changes in other rust crates.
